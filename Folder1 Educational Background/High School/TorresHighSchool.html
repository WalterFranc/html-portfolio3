<H2>History</H2>
<h3>
    <p>Founded by James T. Burns in 1925, Florentino Torres High School was originally named Legarda High School. With only three teachers, Burns opened the school to students who were refused admission by the three existing public high schools in Manila.</p>
    <p>In 1926, the school moved to the Sequoia Building at the foot of Pritil Bridge along Juan Luna Street and was renamed Manila West High School. March 1928 marked the first group of students to graduate from the school as well as the initial appearance of various school clubs and organizations. In 1930, several changes took place under the supervision of Marcelino Bautista, the first Filipino principal, who renamed the four Manila public high schools after the first four Filipino Justices of the Supreme Court:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manila West High School became Florentino Torres High School, in honor of Justice Florentino Torres, the first Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.</li>
        <li>Manila North High School became Arellano High School, in honor of Justice Cayetano Arellano</li>
        <li>Manila South High School became Araullo High School, in honor of Justice Manuel Araullo</li>
        <li>Manila East High School became V. Mapa High School, in honor of Justice Victorino Mapa</li>
    </ul>
