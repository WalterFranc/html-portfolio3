<h4><p>The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP; Tagalog: Politeknikong Unibersidad ng Pilipinas; Spanish: Universidad Politécnica de Filipinas) is a coeducational state university in Manila, Philippines. It was founded on 19 October 1904, as the Manila Business School (MBS) and as part of Manila's public school system. It was eventually promoted to a chartered state university in 1978, by virtue of Presidential Decree 1341. PUP has more than 20 branches and campuses across Central Luzon, Southern Luzon and Metro Manila. With over 70,000 enrolled students, PUP claims to be the largest state university in the Philippines by student population.</p>
<p>The Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017 mandates free tuition and fees for all students of state universities and colleges. Before the act was enforced, the tuition was exactly ₱12 (roughly 24 US cents) per unit (since 1979) for undergraduate students. Students may opt out of the subsidy and choose to pay the full tuition instead.[4] PUP has a reputation for student activism against tuition fee hikes.</p>
<p>PUP is one of the Philippines' top performing higher education institutions, with Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) placing it within the country's top five universities. It ranks 88th in QS' Asian University Ranking - South-Eastern Asia and 551-660th in the Asian University Rankings.</p>
